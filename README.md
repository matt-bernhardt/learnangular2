# Learn Angular2

This is a sandbox repository, part of a [developer challenge](https://gist.github.com/JPrevost/74782c3c94f6e0d3423d) at the [MIT Libraries](https://github.com/mitlibraries/). The challenge was to create an application to display arbitrary repositories in a table, along with their current issues.

I chose Angular2 for my framework. Frankly, this was a bit too ambitious for me, as the framework is one I haven't followed closely - so the fact that seemingly every tutorial or article is out of date made for much frustration.

On the off chance that someone reads this and can offer some advice, I would love to hear from you.
